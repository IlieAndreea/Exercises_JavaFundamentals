/** 1. JF Coding Exercises - Loops Exercises
 *  2. Extra JF Coding Exercises
       1)  Write a simple application that will simulate a shopping. Use only if-else flow control.
 * Consider following cases:
 *
 * If you would like to buy a bottle of milk – cashier will ask you for a specific amount of
 * money. You have to enter that value and verify if it is same as the cashier asked.
 * If you would like to buy a bottle of wine – cashier will ask you if you are an adult and
 * for positive answer ask for a specific amount of money.

      2) Write a “divide by” application. User should be able to enter initial value that will be divided
 * in a loop by a new value entered by a user. Division should occur as long, as entered value
 * will be different than 0. Result of division should be rounded to the fourth decimal point and
 * printed to the console.

     3) Write a simple “echo” application, that will:
 *
 * print back entered string,
 * go to the beginning of a loop if user will enter “continue”,
 * break the loop with a “good bye!” message, if user will enter “quit”.

     4) Write a program that implements the following operations for integer numbers (test the methods in the main() method):
 *
 * Add(+)
 * Subtract(-)
 * Multiply(*)
 * Divide(/)
 * Sqrt
